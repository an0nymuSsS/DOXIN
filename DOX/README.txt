How to stay safe online

-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Never give your first and last name to people you don't know
2. Always have different passwords for each websites and update every 6 months
3. Don't go to a random VOIP calls with other people as they can find your public ip.
However, if they have your ip check if your router is dynamic. You can search it online.
If its dynamic turm router of and back on to change ip address.
If its static. Call your ISP now and ask to change ip.
4. Use a paid vpn to stay safe from hackers.
